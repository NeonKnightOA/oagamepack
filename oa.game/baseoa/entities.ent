The route of the '_celshader' and 'shader'/'_shader' keys MUST omit 'textures/' at the beginning, otherwise it won't work.

This entity can have a model attached to it. For this, the entity must have a 'targetname' key set, and the model must target this entity.

This entity kills players when blocked.

This entity requires an origin. It can either be a square brush of 16x16x16 or 32x32x32 with the common/origin texture in all of its faces as part of the entity, or a pair of coordinates set in the 'origin' key. This origin is also tied to the 'noise' key, as otherwise the sound won't follow the entity as it moves.

Be aware that key game objectives usually don't need the 'gametype' or '!gametype' keys set, unless a map can support a certain gametype or is planned to do so. For example, One Flag CTF and Harvester can be played on asymmetrical map designs due to the nature of the gametypes. This can't be said for Capture the Flag, which is played best on symmetrical maps.

The route of the '_celshader' and 'shader'/'_shader' keys MUST omit 'textures/' at the beginning, otherwise it won't work.

This entity can have a model attached to it. For this, the entity must have a 'targetname' key set, and the model must target this entity.

Upon activation of the targets, all shaders/textures in the map with the shader/texture mentioned in targetShaderName will change to the shader/texture mentioned in targetShaderNewName. This is useful for on/off switches, for example.

This entity requires an origin. It can either be a square brush of 16x16x16 or 32x32x32 with the common/origin texture in all of its faces as part of the entity, or a pair of coordinates set in the 'origin' key. This origin is also tied to the 'noise' key, as otherwise the sound won't follow the entity as it moves.

This entity may not work with mods designed for the game OA is inspired from.

Unless a specific kind of gameplay requires it or you plan to team up items, DON'T set the 'wait' or 'count' keys. You don't want to mess with your players' timing of the items or what the players expect from the items they pick up. If you want to limit an entity to make it viable on your map, rethink the layout of your map so the entity doesn't end overpowered.

Values for the 'gametype' and '!gametype' keys need to be separated by spaces. The valid values are the following for each gametype:
- ffa: Free For All
- team: Team Deathmatch
- tournament: Tournament
- ctf: Capture the Flag
- oneflag: One Flag CTF
- obelisk: Overload
- harvester: Harvester
- elimination: Elimination and CTF Elimination
- lms: Last Man Standing
- dd: Double Domination
- dom: Single Domination
- pos: Possession
