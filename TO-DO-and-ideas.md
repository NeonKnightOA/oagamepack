Here's a list of things that should be done in order to complete the pack, and those that could improve the pack.

## To-Do

* Add the spawnflags to the .ent files.

## Ideas

* A shader generation script, so shaders can be automatically generated and there's consistency across the packs.
* A _shaderlist.txt_ and _default-shaderlist.txt_ regeneration script.
