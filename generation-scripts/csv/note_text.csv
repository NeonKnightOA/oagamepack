"!!vq3compat","This entity may not work with mods designed for the game OA is inspired from."
"!!!spawnpoint_note","Maps must have at least 8 of this kind of spawnpoint without either 'gametype' or '!gametype' in order to prevent friendly telefragging. Bigger maps may require up to 16 of this spawnpoint."
"!broken","This item is broken in some older versions of OA and the game it's inspired from. It may not work."
"origin","This entity requires an origin. It can either be a square brush of 16x16x16 or 32x32x32 with the common/origin texture in all of its faces as part of the entity, or a pair of coordinates set in the 'origin' key. This origin is also tied to the 'noise' key, as otherwise the sound won't follow the entity as it moves."
"origin_brush","This entity can only work with an origin brush as part of this entity. The brush itself must be a square of 16x16x16 or 32x32x32 with the common/origin texture in all of its faces. This origin is also tied to the 'noise' key, as otherwise the sound won't follow the entity as it moves."
"light_note","Lights pointed at a target will be spotlights."
"target_note","Targeting the trigger will toggle its on / off state."
"gametype_note","Values for the 'gametype' and '!gametype' keys need to be separated by spaces. The valid values are the following: ffa tournament single team ctf oneflag obelisk harvester elimination lms dd dom pos"
"!!!!gametype_objective_note","Be aware that key game objectives usually don't need the 'gametype' or '!gametype' keys set, unless a map can support a certain gametype or is planned to do so. For example, One Flag CTF and Harvester can be played on asymmetrical map designs due to the nature of the gametypes. This can't be said for Capture the Flag, which is played best on symmetrical maps."
"team_item_group_note","The respawn time for ''teamed'' items is taken from the 'wait' value of the previously picked up item. If a teamed item has a key-value pair of 'wait -1', items of that team will stop spawing after the one with that value has been picked up. Also, if the 'random' key is set, the respawn time can be anywhere between (minDelay = wait - random) and (maxDelay = wait + random) seconds."
"respawn_count_note","Unless you're designing a map with a specific kind of gameplay in mind, it's advisable to NOT set the 'wait' or 'count' keys. Doing so will mess with what players know about item timings and effects. If you want to limit an entity to make it viable on your map, you should rethink the layout of your map in order for the entity to stop being game-breaking."
"crush_note","This entity kills players when blocked."
"omit_texture_note","The route of the '_celshader' and 'shader'/'_shader' keys MUST omit 'textures/' at the beginning, otherwise it won't work."
"target_model_note","This entity can have a model attached to it. For this, the entity must have a 'targetname' key set, and the model must target this entity."
"targetShaderName_note","Upon activation of the targets, all shaders/textures in the map with the shader/texture mentioned in targetShaderName will change to the shader/texture mentioned in targetShaderNewName. This is useful for on/off switches, for example."
"noise_note","The string '*falling1' in the 'noise' key will play character-specific sounds when the characters are falling into a pit. Sounds need to be formatted in mono, 32-bit PCM is not supported and OGG files will only work if the extension is omitted."
"!!!!misc_model_note","misc_models are models whose only animation comes from shader entities and can only rotate on the Z axis. Models are entirely non-solid, because of this they don't clip against weapon fire or other players, so appropriate clip brushes matching the size and shape of the models must be drawn.
In order to remap a model, use ''*;texturepath'' in order to remap the whole model under a single texture/shader, or ''texturepath1;texturepath2'' in order to remap a specific texture/shader."
"state_targetname_note","The key ''state_targetname'' is used to create warmup-locked doors in round-based gametypes. Before a round begins, these doors are closed, but once a round starts, the doors are opened. The doors return to their closed state after a round is finished."
"worldspawn_enable_note",""
