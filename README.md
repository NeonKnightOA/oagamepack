# OpenArena Gamepack

This repo hosts the GPLv2 gamepack for OpenArena. The intention is to create a fully-GPLv2'd gamepack for any Radiant distributions. Expect files to be changed and deleted as the gamepack is being maintained, as this gamepack is not only a fetch repo but also a maintenance one, trying to fix shader errors in the editor, add missing key shaders (for example, the Alpha shaders for terrains) and missing key images (0% Alpha... 100% Alpha).
