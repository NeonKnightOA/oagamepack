This origin is also tied to the 'noise' key, as otherwise the sound won't follow the entity as it moves.

"notfree" : If set to 1, this entity won't spawn in free-for-all gamemodes.
"notsingle" : If set to 1, this entity won't spawn in single-player mode.
"notteam" : If set to 1, this entity won't spawn in team-based gamemodes.
"random" : Variation of time between respawns. The value is both added and subtracted from \"wait\". Default: 0.0.
"target" : Picking up the item will trigger these targets.
"targetname" : A target_give entity can point at this item so its given to the player.
"team" : If set, the entity is teamed up with items in this team. (See Notes)
"wait" : Seconds before the item respawns again.
-1 = never respawns again. Default: 5.0.
--------- NOTES --------
Values for the 'gametype' and '!gametype' keys need to be separated by spaces. The valid values are the following for each gametype:
- ffa: Free For All
- team: Team Deathmatch
- tournament: Tournament
- ctf: Capture the Flag
- oneflag: One Flag CTF
- obelisk: Overload
- harvester: Harvester
- elimination: Elimination and CTF Elimination
- lms: Last Man Standing
- dd: Double Domination
- dom: Single Domination
- pos: Possession
Unless a specific kind of gameplay requires it or you plan to team up items, DON'T set the 'wait' or 'count' keys. You don't want to mess with your players' timing of the items or what the players expect from the items they pick up. If you want to limit an entity to make it viable on your map, rethink the layout of your map so the entity doesn't end overpowered.
