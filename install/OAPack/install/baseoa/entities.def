You don't want to mess with your players' timing of the items or what the players expect from the items they pick up. If you want to limit an entity to make it viable on your map, rethink the layout of your map so the entity doesn't end overpowered.
Upon activation of the targets, all shaders/textures in the map with the shader/texture mentioned in targetShaderName will change to the shader/texture mentioned in targetShaderNewName. This is useful for on/off switches, for example.

--------- MODEL FOR RADIANT ONLY - DO NOT SET THIS AS A KEY --------
model="models/dpoints/a_white.md3"
Domination Control Point.
--------- KEYS --------
"angle" : Determines a facing angle. Default: 0.0.
"gametype" : If set, the entity will ONLY appear in these gametypes. (See Notes)
"!gametype" : If set, the entity will NOT appear in these gametypes. (See Notes)
"message" : Gives the point a name which is displayed in-game. (MAX length: 19 chars)
"notbot" : If set to 1, a bot will never attempt to pick up this item.
"notfree" : If set to 1, this entity won't spawn in free-for-all gamemodes.
"notsingle" : If set to 1, this entity won't spawn in single-player mode.
"notteam" : If set to 1, this entity won't spawn in team-based gamemodes.
"target" : Picking up the item will trigger these targets.
--------- NOTES --------
This entity may not work with mods designed for the game OA is inspired from.
Values for the 'gametype' and '!gametype' keys need to be separated by spaces. The valid values are the following for each gametype:
- ffa: Free For All
- team: Team Deathmatch
- tournament: Tournament
- ctf: Capture the Flag
- oneflag: One Flag CTF
- obelisk: Overload
- harvester: Harvester
- elimination: Elimination and CTF Elimination
- lms: Last Man Standing
- dd: Double Domination
- dom: Single Domination
- pos: Possession
Be aware that key game objectives usually don't need the 'gametype' or '!gametype' keys set, unless a map can support a certain gametype or is planned to do so. For example, One Flag CTF and Harvester can be played on asymmetrical map designs due to the nature of the gametypes. This can't be said for Capture the Flag, which is played best on symmetrical maps.

This entity requires an origin. It can either be a square brush of 16x16x16 or 32x32x32 with the common/origin texture in all of its faces as part of the entity, or a pair of coordinates set in the 'origin' key. This origin is also tied to the 'noise' key, as otherwise the sound won't follow the entity as it moves.
The route of the '_celshader' and 'shader'/'_shader' keys MUST omit 'textures/' at the beginning, otherwise it won't work.
This entity can have a model attached to it. For this, the entity must have a 'targetname' key set, and the model must target this entity.
Upon activation of the targets, all shaders/textures in the map with the shader/texture mentioned in targetShaderName will change to the shader/texture mentioned in targetShaderNewName. This is useful for on/off switches, for example.

misc_models are models whose only animation comes from shader entities and can only rotate on the Z axis. Models are entirely non-solid, because of this they don't clip against weapon fire or other players, so appropriate clip brushes matching the size and shape of the models must be drawn.

In order to remap a model, use ''*;[texturepath]\'' in order to remap the whole model under a single texture/shader, or ''[texturepath1];[texturepath2]'' in order to remap a specific texture/shader.

/*QUAKED worldspawn (0 0 0) ?
The main entity of the map. Every map should have exactly one worldspawn.
--------- KEYS --------
"_ambient;ambient" : Constant value added to the overall lighting. Use not recommended, since ambient light has a tendency to flatten out variations in light and shade.
"_blocksize" : Size of the blocks q3map2 vis uses in order to calculate what's drawn in the screen. Higher values than the default are recommended for very large maps with low structural brush count. The calculation is based on the formulas X=_blocksize*n; Y=_blocksize*n. Default: 1024.
"_color" : Color of the ambient light. Default: 0 0 0.
"gravity" : Gravity of the level. Overrides the default value, is overriden by the game's set gravity value. Default: 800.0.
"gridsize" : Size of the lightgrid created by q3map2. The values represent the units in the X Y Z points. Large powers of 2 help reduce the BSP size and compile time on very large maps. Default: 128 128 256.
"message" : Name of the map. Displayed on the loading screen.
"_castshadows;_cs" : Per-entity control over shadow casting. The values it can take are:
* Under -1: Cast shadows on entities with _rs or _receiveshadows but NOT in the world.
* -1: Doesn't cast shadows on the world.
* 0: Casts shadows on entities. (Default)
* 1: Casts shadows on the world. (Also default)
* Over 1: Casts shadows on entities with _rs or _receiveshadows AND in the world.
"_celshader" : Cel shader used for this geometry.
"_farplanedist" : Amount of units the vis phase can see during compilation. In combination with level-wide fog, it can help reduce tris count on large, open maps.
"_foghull" : If set, the level will use the fog properties of this shader in order to render a level-wide fog.
"_keeplights" : Keeps lights in the BSP, preventing q3map2 from stripping them in the light phase.
"_lightmapscale" : Scales the resolution of lightmaps on brushes and patches in the world. Func_ entities can override this value. Default: 1.0.
"_mingridlight" : Minimum value of dynamic entity lighting, level-wide.
"_minlight" : Minimum value of world-wide lighting, level-wide, which uses ''_color'' to add a color to the ambience. Unlike _ambient and ambient, it does not add values to the other light entities.
"_minvertexlight" : Minimum value of vertex lighting, level-wide.
"_noshadersun" : Ignores the sky properties of the sky shaders, and ONLY uses entity sun lights.
"_receiveshadows;_rs" : Per-entity control over shadow reception. The values it can take are:
* 0: Doesn't receive shadows.
* Range (0,1): Receive shadows from both entities with _cs or _castshadows and world.
* 1: Receive shadows on everything (world shadows). This is the default value.
* Over 1: Receive shadows ONLY from entities with _cs or _castshadows.
"_indexmap;alphamap" : Path of the art file used to guide the mapping of textures on the terrain surface.
"_layers;layers" : Number of unique root shaders that will be used on the terrain surface.
"_shader;shader" : Metashader used to assign textures to the terrain entity.
"_style1alphaGen" : AlphaGen value for the light style index 1. Values takes standard shader waveform functions (e.g. wave sin 0.5 0.3 0.25 1.5).
