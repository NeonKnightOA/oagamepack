Unless a specific kind of gameplay requires it or you plan to team up items, DON'T set the 'wait' or 'count' keys. You don't want to mess with your players' timing of the items or what the players expect from the items they pick up. If you want to limit an entity to make it viable on your map, rethink the layout of your map so the entity doesn't end overpowered.

-------- NOTES --------
This entity may not work with mods designed for the game OA is inspired from.
Values for the 'gametype' and '!gametype' keys need to be separated by spaces. The valid values are the following for each gametype:
- ffa: Free For All
- team: Team Deathmatch
- tournament: Tournament
- ctf: Capture the Flag
- oneflag: One Flag CTF
- obelisk: Overload
- harvester: Harvester
- elimination: Elimination and CTF Elimination
- lms: Last Man Standing
- dd: Double Domination
- dom: Single Domination
- pos: Possession
Be aware that key game objectives usually don't need the 'gametype' or '!gametype' keys set, unless a map can support a certain gametype or is planned to do so. For example, One Flag CTF and Harvester can be played on asymmetrical map designs due to the nature of the gametypes. This can't be said for Capture the Flag, which is played best on symmetrical maps.

Values for the 'gametype' and '!gametype' keys need to be separated by spaces. The valid values are the following for each gametype:
- ffa: Free For All
- team: Team Deathmatch
- tournament: Tournament

- oneflag: One Flag CTF
- obelisk: Overload
- harvester: Harvester
- elimination: Elimination and CTF Elimination
- lms: Last Man Standing
- dd: Double Domination
- dom: Single Domination
- pos: Possession
Unless a specific kind of gameplay requires it or you plan to team up items, DON'T set the 'wait' or 'count' keys. You don't want to mess with your players' timing of the items or what the players expect from the items they pick up. If you want to limit an entity to make it viable on your map, rethink the layout of your map so the entity doesn't end overpowered.

Values for the 'gametype' and '!gametype' keys need to be separated by spaces. The valid values are the following for each gametype:

- team: Team Deathmatch

- harvester: Harvester

Be aware that key game objectives usually don't need the 'gametype' or '!gametype' keys set, unless a map can support a certain gametype or is planned to do so.
