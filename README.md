# OpenArena Gamepack

## Overview
This repo hosts the GPLv2 gamepack for OpenArena. The intention is to create a fully-GPLv2'd gamepack for any Radiant distributions. Expect files to be changed and deleted as the gamepack is being maintained.

## Content
This gamepack contains definition files for OA 0.8.8.

The gamepacks contains fully generated entities.ent and entities.def for both XML and regular versions of the NetRadiant editors.
