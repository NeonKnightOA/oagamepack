-------- NOTES --------
First and foremost: It is NOT advisable to change the respawn time of an item, or the amount of ammo given by a weapon/box, because you are messing with the player's natural timing of the items. You're doing well with the default values. That said...

The "wait" value of a "teamed" item will determine the respawn time of the following one. Setting one of the items to -1 (no respawn) will prevent further items from spawning, after that one.

Using "random" key will make the respawn time variable, to the maximum limits given by "random" added or subtracted to "wait" seconds. Example: "wait 10" with "random 2" will make the item respawn between 8 and 12 seconds of delay.

First and foremost: It is NOT advisable to change the respawn time of an item, or the amount of ammo given by a weapon/box, because you are messing with the player's natural timing of the items. You're doing well with the default values. That said...

The "wait" value of a "teamed" item will determine the respawn time of the following one. Setting one of the items to -1 (no respawn) will prevent further items from spawning, after that one.

Using "random" key will make the respawn time variable, to the maximum limits given by "random" added or subtracted to "wait" seconds. Example: "wait 10" with "random 2" will make the item respawn between 8 and 12 seconds of delay.

Also, if you have doubts about placing the Railgun in your map, remember that it is going to be played in Instagib mode. Plan your map with limiting the weapon's powerfulness in mind. That said...

-------- NOTES --------
For brushes and patches to get a better lightmap, group them into func_group entities and use the key-value pair "_lightmapscale" "0.125".

OA isn't that good at rendering curved shadows or angled shadows. You can end up with ugly jagged shadows if the light is emitted from or hits geometry at certain angles. Changing light sources can help, also making affected geometry into func_group entities and assigning the keys "_rc" or "_cs" with a value of 0 is a useful trick. The "_rc" key prevents shadows being cast on to geometry, and "_cs" prevents it from casting shadows.

-------- NOTES --------
Rising platforms may be problematic for bots, as they may go under them, unable to get on them and acting stupidly. To avoid this problem, lifts should be designed in a pillar-like way, fully filling the gap between their top position and the ground. This may be done by extending the brushes to actually look like a pillar, but also by making an invisible pillar through the use of clip brushes ("botclip" may be the best one, as it only affects bots).
Also pay attention in case you have something ''under'' the platform (e.g. a lower floor room), as the pillar may affect it when the lift is lowered.

Unless you set the "height" key, the total movement of the rising platform is given by subtracting the "lip" value to the total vertical height of the brushes which compose it. In case "height" is set, then "lip" value and brush size will be ignored, and the plat will go up for the specified amount of units: this also allows the platform to go up many times more than its own height (however it's advisable to make the lift pillar-like, for bots!).

WARNING: older documentation may tell you to create and include your own pt1_strt.wav and pt1_end.wav files. Do NOT do it for OpenArena maps, as OpenArena has already got those sounds. That note was just a leftover from documentation designed for Q3A.

It is optionally possible to set "origin" key instead of having an origin brush. If using "model2" key, the origin brush or the "origin" key will be used as the origin of the model.

It is possible to attach a misc_model to this entity by setting the same value to "target" key there and "targetname" key here.

-------- NOTES --------
Trains need a "closed" circuit of path_corner entities, do not emit sounds, cannot be rotated and are always on (they cannot be trigger-controlled). They pass through other solid brushes.

Up to OpenArena 0.8.8, they can push a player in front of their path, but GET STUCK with an ugly "shake" effect in case said player gets blocked by something else, like another player or a wall. They also GET STUCK in case they encounter a dropped weapon in front of their path.
With gamecode changes introduced AFTER OA 0.8.8 (which DO NOT affect previous mods!), trains do NOT get stuck anymore, but DESTROY players which would have blocked them and PASS THROUGH items which would have blocked them.
As your map may be played with older gamecode (e.g. Q3A mods), it's still advisable to place "common/nodrop" all along the path of the train, or to make it "fly" above players' height, trying to minimize the chances of the train becoming blocked.

It is optionally possible to set "origin" key instead of having an origin brush. If using "model2" key, the origin brush or the "origin" key will be used as the origin of the model.

It is possible to attach a misc_model to this entity by setting the same value to "target" key there and "targetname" key here.

First and foremost: It is NOT advisable to change the respawn time of an item, or the amount of ammo given by a weapon/box, because you are messing with the player's natural timing of the items. You're doing well with the default values. That said...

The "wait" value of a "teamed" item will determine the respawn time of the following one. Setting one of the items to -1 (no respawn) will prevent further items from spawning, after that one.

Using "random" key will make the respawn time variable, to the maximum limits given by "random" added or subtracted to "wait" seconds. Example: "wait 10" with "random 2" will make the item respawn between 8 and 12 seconds of delay.

-------- NOTES --------
Runes are not supported by most old mods for Q3A and will spawn in baseoa only if g_runes CVAR is set to 1 (default is 0). 

The standard use of the Runes is to place them in the two bases, and use the "spawnflags" to allow the players of a team to get only those in their base. But it's also possible to place them in the middle of the map, without team limits: this would make the two teams battle to get them. It may be a good idea to set "notfree" key on team-dedicated runes.

The Runes are also used to counteract the effect of overpowered weapons, as without them one has to consider the Nailgun, the Chaingun and the Prox Launcher as superweapons on par with the BFG.

Runes respawn immediately after previous user's death.

The "wait" value of a "teamed" item will determine the respawn time of the following one. Setting one of the items to -1 (no respawn) will prevent further items from spawning, after that one.

Using "random" key will make the respawn time variable, to the maximum limits given by "random" added or subtracted to "wait" seconds. Example: "wait 10" with "random 2" will make the item respawn between 8 and 12 seconds of delay.

First and foremost: It is NOT advisable to change the respawn time of an item, or the amount of ammo given by a weapon/box, because you are messing with the player's natural timing of the items. You're doing well with the default values. That said...

The "wait" value of a "teamed" item will determine the respawn time of the following one. Setting one of the items to -1 (no respawn) will prevent further items from spawning, after that one.

Using "random" key will make the respawn time variable, to the maximum limits given by "random" added or subtracted to "wait" seconds. Example: "wait 10" with "random 2" will make the item respawn between 8 and 12 seconds of delay.

-------- NOTES --------
Runes are not supported by most old mods for Q3A and will spawn in baseoa only if g_runes CVAR is set to 1 (default is 0). 

The standard use of the Runes is to place them in the two bases, and use the "spawnflags" to allow the players of a team to get only those in their base. But it's also possible to place them in the middle of the map, without team limits: this would make the two teams battle to get them. It may be a good idea to set "notfree" key on team-dedicated runes.

The Runes are also used to counteract the effect of overpowered weapons, as without them one has to consider the Nailgun, the Chaingun and the Prox Launcher as superweapons on par with the BFG.

Runes respawn immediately after previous user's death.

The "wait" value of a "teamed" item will determine the respawn time of the following one. Setting one of the items to -1 (no respawn) will prevent further items from spawning, after that one.

Using "random" key will make the respawn time variable, to the maximum limits given by "random" added or subtracted to "wait" seconds. Example: "wait 10" with "random 2" will make the item respawn between 8 and 12 seconds of delay.

-------- NOTES --------
First and foremost: It is NOT advisable to change the respawn time of an item, or the amount of ammo given by a weapon/box, because you are messing with the player's natural timing of the items. You're doing well with the default values. That said...

The "wait" value of a "teamed" item will determine the respawn time of the following one. Setting one of the items to -1 (no respawn) will prevent further items from spawning, after that one.

Using "random" key will make the respawn time variable, to the maximum limits given by "random" added or subtracted to "wait" seconds. Example: "wait 10" with "random 2" will make the item respawn between 8 and 12 seconds of delay.

-------- NOTES --------
Runes are not supported by most old mods for Q3A and will spawn in baseoa only if g_runes CVAR is set to 1 (default is 0). 

The standard use of the Runes is to place them in the two bases, and use the "spawnflags" to allow the players of a team to get only those in their base. But it's also possible to place them in the middle of the map, without team limits: this would make the two teams battle to get them. It may be a good idea to set "notfree" key on team-dedicated runes.

The Runes are also used to counteract the effect of overpowered weapons, as without them one has to consider the Nailgun, the Chaingun and the Prox Launcher as superweapons on par with the BFG.

Runes respawn immediately after previous user's death.

The "wait" value of a "teamed" item will determine the respawn time of the following one. Setting one of the items to -1 (no respawn) will prevent further items from spawning, after that one.

Using "random" key will make the respawn time variable, to the maximum limits given by "random" added or subtracted to "wait" seconds. Example: "wait 10" with "random 2" will make the item respawn between 8 and 12 seconds of delay.

-------- NOTES --------
Bots don't use light information. In a pitch-black room, they would still see an opponent. Keep that in mind when designing your maps.

Use coloured lights with care, to emphasis light emitted from flame for example, but let subtlety be your guide.

Colors are expressed in RGB (red-green-blue) values, but not going from 0 to 255 like many programs do: their range is from 0.0 to 1.0. Hence, if you know an RGB color on 255-scale as R 241, G 55, B 100, you have to "normalize" those values by calculating 241/255=0.94509, 55/255=0.21568 and 100/255=0.39215.

Sometimes it may be necessary or desirable to have the light source some distance from the area where you require the light to fall. This 'spot light' effect can be achieved by targeting a light entity at a target_position or an info_null entity. Unfortunately the editor can not show lighting effect in real time, so it is necessary to compile the map in order to observe the effect you have created. Sometimes it may take 3 or 4 attempts to achieve the result you want, adjusting the strength of the light source and the distance and angle from the info_null.

First and foremost: It is NOT advisable to change the respawn time of an item, or the amount of ammo given by a weapon/box, because you are messing with the player's natural timing of the items. You're doing well with the default values. That said...

BFG is considered a superweapon, so it is usually placed in difficult or dangerous areas, or not included at all.

The "wait" value of a "teamed" item will determine the respawn time of the following one. Setting one of the items to -1 (no respawn) will prevent further items from spawning, after that one.

Using "random" key will make the respawn time variable, to the maximum limits given by "random" added or subtracted to "wait" seconds. Example: "wait 10" with "random 2" will make the item respawn between 8 and 12 seconds of delay.

-------- NOTES --------
If you don't plan on adding the Runes, treat the weapon as a Superweapon on par with the BFG.

When playing a map with most old mods designed for Quake 3, nothing will spawn in the place of the Missionpack items. For this reason, be sure your map has enough "standard" weapons to be playable also in mods which do not support the three TA weapons. A possible trick is to use the "team" key to make a Team Arena item (usually a weapon) to spawn alternately with a standard item. This way, in old mods, the standard item will spawn each time. 

It is NOT advisable to change the respawn time of an item, or the amount of ammo given by a weapon/box, because you are messing with the player's natural timing of the items. You're doing well with the default values. That said...

The "wait" value of a "teamed" item will determine the respawn time of the following one. Setting one of the items to -1 (no respawn) will prevent further items from spawning, after that one.

-------- NOTES --------
First and foremost: It is NOT advisable to change the respawn time of an item, or the amount of ammo given by a weapon/box, because you are messing with the player's natural timing of the items. You're doing well with the default values.

Also, if you have doubts about placing the Railgun in your map, remember that it is going to be played in Instagib mode. Plan your map with limiting the weapon's powerfulness in mind. That said...

The "wait" value of a "teamed" item will determine the respawn time of the following one. Setting one of the items to -1 (no respawn) will prevent further items from spawning, after that one.

Using "random" key will make the respawn time variable, to the maximum limits given by "random" added or subtracted to "wait" seconds. Example: "wait 10" with "random 2" will make the item respawn between 8 and 12 seconds of delay.

-------- NOTES --------
Ambient lighting has the tendency to flatten the difference between light and shadow, so its use is NOT recommended. Use "_minlight" instead, which raises the lighting level-wise, but keeps the light values of each entity/sky/shader intact. In case you decide to use one of them, you have to also specify "_color" key, which specifies the color of the light.

In any case, abuse of ambient and "_minlight" lighting (and in most cases, also use) isn't recommended. The best thing to do regarding lighting is to light the level oneself, placing lights where needed and creating sky shaders with appropriate parameters.
