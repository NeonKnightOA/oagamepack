--------- NOTES --------
Be aware that key game objectives usually don't need the 'gametype' or '!gametype' keys set, unless a map can support a certain gametype or is planned to do so. For example, One Flag CTF and Harvester can be played on asymmetrical map designs due to the nature of the gametypes. This can't be said for Capture the Flag, which is played best on symmetrical maps.

This entity may not work with mods designed for the game OA is inspired from.

Values for the 'gametype' and '!gametype' keys need to be separated by spaces. The valid values are the following for each gametype:
- ffa: Free For All
- team: Team Deathmatch
- tournament: Tournament
- ctf: Capture the Flag
- oneflag: One Flag CTF
- obelisk: Overload
- harvester: Harvester
- elimination: Elimination and CTF Elimination

Unless a specific kind of gameplay requires it or you plan to team up items, DON'T set the 'wait' or 'count' keys. You don't want to mess with your players' timing of the items or what the players expect from the items they pick up. If you want to limit an entity to make it viable on your map, rethink the layout of your map so the entity doesn't end overpowered.

Upon activation of the targets, all shaders/textures in the map with the shader/texture mentioned in targetShaderName will change to the shader/texture mentioned in targetShaderNewName. This is useful for on/off switches, for example.

--------- KEYS --------
"count" : Amount of ammo given to the player on pickup. Default: 10.
"gametype" : If set, the entity will ONLY appear in these gametypes. (See Notes)
"!gametype" : If set, the entity will NOT appear in these gametypes. (See Notes)
"notbot" : If set to 1, a bot will never attempt to pick up this item.
"notfree" : If set to 1, this entity won't spawn in free-for-all gamemodes.
"notsingle" : If set to 1, this entity won't spawn in single-player mode.
"notteam" : If set to 1, this entity won't spawn in team-based gamemodes.
"random" : Variation of time between respawns. The value is both added and subtracted from \"wait\". Default: 0.0.
"targetShaderName" : Shader to be swapped out for triggerable shader entities. (See Notes)
"targetShaderNewName" : Shader to be swapped in for triggerable shader entities. (See Notes)
"target" : Picking up the item will trigger these targets.
"targetname" : A target_give entity can point at this item so its given to the player.
"team" : If set, the entity is teamed up with items in this team. (See Notes)
"wait" : Seconds before the item respawns again.
-1 = never respawns again. Default: 5.0.
--------- NOTES --------
Values for the 'gametype' and '!gametype' keys need to be separated by spaces. The valid values are the following for each gametype:
- ffa: Free For All
- team: Team Deathmatch
- tournament: Tournament
- ctf: Capture the Flag
- oneflag: One Flag CTF
- obelisk: Overload
- harvester: Harvester
- elimination: Elimination and CTF Elimination
- lms: Last Man Standing
- dd: Double Domination
- dom: Single Domination
- pos: Possession

Unless a specific kind of gameplay requires it or you plan to team up items, DON'T set the 'wait' or 'count' keys. You don't want to mess with your players' timing of the items or what the players expect from the items they pick up. If you want to limit an entity to make it viable on your map, rethink the layout of your map so the entity doesn't end overpowered.

Upon activation of the targets, all shaders/textures in the map with the shader/texture mentioned in targetShaderName will change to the shader/texture mentioned in targetShaderNewName. This is useful for on/off switches, for example.
